In this application I've tested & implemented several Angular features to improve my knowledge about the Framework. Some of them are:
  - Generating modules/components/services/resolvers/custom validators/routing modules;
  - Refactoring the application, so that every different module encapsulates it's logic
  - Implemented routing & lazy loading for the modules that are not needed on the initial start-up;
  - Added Firebase to create authentication & user database;
  - Created class interfaces;
  - Used TypeScript classes and syntax
  - Used the Firebase authentication responses to save the user's data inside the local storage;
  - Added Authentication Guards to protect routes
  - Built Reactive Login and Registration forms, that use Built-In, Custom and Async Validators
  - Using the Http object for Ajax calls along with RxJS observables
  - Implemented RxJs Behaviour Subjects
